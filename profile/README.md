**AIRobot Open Source Platform Project**

The AIRobot project, started in 2022, is sponsored by Axiologic Research (www.axiologic.net) and is a collaboration with external industry experts and academic researchers.

Currently, it is at a low TRL level (TRL2-3). Still, after the first applications are validated, they will be released as an MIT license core component and a set of commercially licensed plugins. 

Current visions are depicted in the above image:

Current experimental applications that are planned to be developed are:
- a mobile application for farmers
- a social network based on blockchain technologies and capabilities to enable co-creation and the initiation of decentralized brands (a concept presented in this book chapter:  "Balan, A., Alboaie, S., Alboaie, S., Kourtit, K., and Nijkamp, P. (2022), Livable Cities as an instantiation of Decentralized Brands. In: The Future of Liveable Cities (L. Fusco Girard, P. Nijkamp and Kourtit, K.). Franco Angeli, ".

This project is reusing blockchain technologies (wallets, cryptographic keys handling, privacy-preserving technologies.)  from the OpenDSU project (https://wwww.opendsu.com)
